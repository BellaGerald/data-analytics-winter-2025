# **AI Foundations Assignment: Evaluating ChatGPT as a Data Tutor**

## **Objective**  
This assignment aims to help students critically evaluate the effectiveness of using ChatGPT as a data tutor by analyzing its responses, comparing it to Google, and understanding when to use each resource for problem-solving. You will use your spreadsheet and pivot tables from your course pre-work to complete this assignment.

## **Instructions**

### 1. **Introduction**  
Write a short paragraph below describing the role of AI tools like ChatGPT in learning data analytics. Include your expectations for how ChatGPT can assist in your learning process.

Using tools like ChatGPT can help with understanding and processing large amounts of data. You can ask a question, and AI can provide a wealth of information and options.				
AI is a great tool for providing information efficiently, but it does have its limits.  It can make mistakes or provide inaccurate information.  It is important to always verify the information and make sure that it is accurate.  I use it on a daily basis to answer emails and make it sound more professional.  I am sure there are many ways to use AI that I do not realize.  It is exciting to learn about this new technology and how it can help in so many different ways.

### 2. **Data Task: Sorting in Pivot Charts**  

You will ask ChatGPT the following question:  
**_"How do you sort the values in a pivot chart by descending order in Excel?"_** (or Google Sheets if that is what you are using) 

- **a. Ask ChatGPT:**  
  - Screenshot ChatGPT's response and include below. 
  - Implement the instructions provided by ChatGPT in Excel or Google Sheets to test if they work.

  - 

- **b. Analysis:**  
  - Evaluate the response: Was the explanation clear? Did the steps work? Were there any errors or missing steps?  
  - Suggest how the explanation could be improved, if necessary.
  - 
I feel that the directions were not easy to follow.  I am more of a visual learner, so just reading the information is confusing.  I am not that familiar with Google sheets so it was not easy to follow.  I feel that it really did not have a step by step instruction and it was not detailed enough.

### 3. **Comparison**  
- Use Google to search for the same solution (e.g., "sort pivot chart by descending order in Excel").  
- Compare the Google search experience to ChatGPTâ€™s response:  
  - Was the Google result more or less detailed?  
  - Did you find videos, articles, or blog posts helpful?  
  - Include any relevant link(s) you found helpful and explain why.
  - 
The Google search started with offering detailed instructions on how to use Google sheets.  After scrolling down, it gave me a lot of more options.  There were articles and videos to assist with the questions.  Sometimes Google can offer too much general information and you have to spend some time looking through all of the options.  I ended up looking at a video which helped me figure out what to do.

### 4. **Pick Another Scenario*  
- Ask ChatGPT another data question as it relates to how to do something in excel/google sheets 
- Which resource you found most effective for this? 
---How to use the query function in google sheets.

  Both offered an extensive answer. If you are trying to relay the information to someone, ChatGPT would work better.  ChatGPT is good at having the information sound professional and giving a good overview.  Google provides more detailed and visual instruction.

### 5. **When to Use Which Resource**  
Write a short response below explaining when it would be appropriate to use ChatGPT or Google. Consider factors like:  
- Time sensitivity  
- Complexity of the problem  
- Need for detailed visual instructions  
- Level of confidence in verifying the accuracy of the information  

It would depend on what I was asking.  I like AI for general questions or if I am stuck on how to explain something.  For more indepth information or something that is more complex I would start with ChatGPT and see what information it provides, and would also check Google for accuracy and extended information on the subject.

### 6. **Final Reflection**  
Reflect on your experience using ChatGPT vs Google and describe:  
- Which resource you found most effective for this task and why.  
- How this exercise influenced your approach to learning new data skills in the future.  

---I like both.  I depends on what I am asking on whether I decide to go to Google or ChatGPT.  I have not used ChatGPT other than assistance with questions.  I would like to use it more because I think it can be a resource and assistance with so many things.

## **Submission Requirements:**
